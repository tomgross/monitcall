================

Monitcall is a small script to run executeables and
watch for deadlocks in the process.

Usage: monitcall [-h] [-a ARGS] [-t CYCLES] [-l LIMIT] [-s SIGNAL]
                 [-d DEBUGLOG] [-v] cmd

The script will call the given command (CMD) together with the
given arguments (ARGS). If the CPU usage of the command is higher
than the given limit (LIMIT) for more than CYCLES cycles
the command is killed with the signal SIGNAL.

Example:
monitcall wvWare -a '-c utf-8 --nographics mydocument.doc'

Extracts the contents of the MS-Word document `mydocument.doc` to
an utf-8 text printed on stdout.

Known issues:
  - The option string must not start with `-a`. Like this:

    ... -a '-a 4 -c utf-8 ...'
    This seems to be a bug in the argparse module
